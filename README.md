# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn how to use websocket in our Flutter apps. We'll be using [Go Simple Chat](https://github.com/apm-dev/go-simple-chat/tree/ws) project to equip our app with a real-time in memory chat server and authentication.


## What you will create

We’re going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
